The Email Application project is a Java program that allows users to create email accounts with customized features. The application prompts the user to enter their first name and last name, and based on their input, generates a unique email address for them.

The main features of the Email Application include:

Department Selection: The user is asked to select their department from a list of options (Sales, Development, Accounting, or None). The selected department is incorporated into the generated email address.

Random Password Generation: The application generates a random password for each user. The password is a combination of uppercase letters and special characters.

Customizable Settings: Users can modify their mailbox capacity and set an alternate email address. They can also change their password if needed.

Information Display: The application provides a summary of the user's account information, including their display name, company email address, and mailbox capacity.

The Email Application project utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes and methods, to encapsulate the functionality of creating and managing email accounts. It demonstrates the use of user input, string manipulation, and randomization techniques.
